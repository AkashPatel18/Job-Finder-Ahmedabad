MeasureOne was formed by a team of people passionate about using consumer-permissioned data to create opportunities for both businesses and consumers. Consumer-permissioned data puts the consumer at the center of each and every data transaction. With this model, consumers can leverage and harness the power of their personal data, while businesses can use and gain insights from this valuable data. Once limited to the financial services industry, the MeasureOne platform enables a broad range of businesses to access and deliver consumer-credentialed source data with the full permission of the consumer. Consumers have full control over who can access their data, for what purposes, and how it is retained. Thus, MeasureOne eliminates all layers between the business and consumer for a highly efficient experience.

YouTube is definitely not your father's method of sharing video footage. The company has amassed a collection of user generated content, thousands of short films and television episodes, and hundreds of full-length movies. Serving more than two billion videos a day, it has become the clear leader in online video sharing. YouTube primarily earns revenue by selling ads on its homepage and search results pages, as well as within its videos. It also charges users to watch certain videos through its YouTube Rentals service. The company was founded in 2005 by Steve Chen (former CTO) and Chad Hurley (former CEO). Today it is a subsidiary of Internet search giant Google.

Ever been SuperPoked or had someone write on your Funwall? Thank this company, which has slid its way into the collective consciousness of the Internet generation. Slide develops technology that helps users put photos on the Web and present them through customized slide shows. Although the company provides image hosting, personalization tools, and social networking opportunities through Slide.com, the company's popularity stems from users of third party sites such as MySpace, Facebook, and Bebo, who use Slide applications to insert slide shows, pictures, or video clips onto their own profile pages. Founded by Max Levchin (of PayPal fame), the company was launched in 2005.
